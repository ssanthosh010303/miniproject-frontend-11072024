## Serve

Make sure Node.js and NPM are installed on your system. To server the static files locally, first run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
cd "./<project-dir>"
npm install
```

Now start the Express server with the following command:

```bash
node ./server.js
```

If Node.js and NPM is not installed on your system, you can server the static files in the `/public/` folder with Python's `http.server` or Live Server Extension for VS Code.
